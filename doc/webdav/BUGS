One or two things do not work with Webdav.  These include:

It is recommended that either Netdrive or Konqueror is used as a client
for webdav.  These clients produce the most consistent results with
the DocMGR webdav server.

Checking files in and out (locking)

Copying a folder into a directory that already contains a folder of the same
name.

I can't seem to open a folder that has "()" in the name

Gnome VFS 2.10
	If you copy over a file that already exists, the file is not updated
	as a new revision.  Gnome VFS deletes files it believes its
	overwriting before uploading the new file.  This is contrary
	to common behavior of other clients, which usually allows the
	server to handle such an event.

	For some reason, it can't handle files with a "'" in the name,
	like "John's Files".  I'm researching this, and hope to have
	it fixed soon.
